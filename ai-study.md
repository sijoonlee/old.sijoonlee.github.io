## Lesson 2 Deep Learning With PyTorch

### [Part 2](/ai-study/secure-and-private-ai/deep-learning-with-pytorch/part2)
- How to use torch.sum()
- What is [:] ?
- What is '-1' in tensor.view(9, -1) ?

### [Part 3](/ai-study/secure-and-private-ai/deep-learning-with-pytorch/part3)
- External Learning Sources to understand log softmax and NLL

### [Part 5](/ai-study/secure-and-private-ai/deep-learning-with-pytorch/part5)
- What is "For-Else" Statement
- Plotting Train Losses vs Test Losses by using matplotlib

### [Part 6](/ai-study/secure-and-private-ai/deep-learning-with-pytorch/part6)
- What is "for in" statement?

### [Part 7](/ai-study/secure-and-private-ai/deep-learning-with-pytorch/part7)
- This is Neural Network training of Cat vs Dog Data set
- It sums up what I have learned up until this point
    - loading data
    - setup model
    - training & validating network
    - saving and loading model checkpoint
- The accuracy wasn't good at all ( ~ 0.5 )
